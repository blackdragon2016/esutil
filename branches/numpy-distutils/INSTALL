If your fortran 95 compiler is found, you can simply type

    python setup.py install --prefix=/some/path

If the fortran compiler is not found automatically, you can try this sequence:
    python setup.py build --fcompiler=name
    python setup.py install --prefix=/some/path

Where name can be, e.g., gnu95, ifort
