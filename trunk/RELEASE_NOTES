-----------------------------------------------
Additions:
	pyfitspatch:
		A patched version of pyfits that allows writing binary tables from a
		numpy array with fields, recarray, etc. with a single call.  The io.py
		sub-module uses this for input and output from FITS.  The patches have
		been sent to the pyfits people and when incorporated pyfitspatch will
		be dropped.

	numpy_util.ahelp():  
        Print out a formatted description of the input array.   If the array
        has fields, individual descriptions are printed for each field.  This
        is designed to be similar to help, struct, /str in IDL. 

	misc.colprint():
		Print a set of input sequences or arrays in columns.

-----------------------------------------------
v0.3.0 (2010-04-04)

New files and packages:
	htm package:  
		Added C++ code for working with the Heierarchical Triangular Mesh
		(HTM).  This is a code for breaking the sky into spherical triangles, a
		quad tree, which makes for fast searching.  Includes the class HTM with
		methods such as lookup_id for finding the htm id of an ra,dec, match
		for finding matches between lists of ra,dec and bincount for counting
		pairs in radial bins, useful for calculating correlation functions.

	integrate.py: 
		Tools for numerical integration.  Currently has a class for performing
		gauss-legendre integration.

	plotting.py: 
		Tools for plotting with matplotlib.  
			setuplot() for setting up the plotting and establishing a plot
				object.
			set_mino0r_ticks() for setting up minor tick mark locations in
				a smart way.
			whiskers: Plot whiskers, or arrowless vectors.
	random.py:  
		Contains a class for generating random points from an arbitrary
		probability distribution.

	coords.py:  
		astro_util.py is now coords.py, appropriate since all the code was
		coordinate transformations.
	
Other Changes:
	Numerous changes that I forgot to write into this release notes. Will be
	more diligent in the future.
