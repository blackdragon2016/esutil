Package:
    esutil

Sub-packages:
    htm:  
        Tools for working with the Hierarchical Triangular Mesh, whic his a
        method for breaking the unit sphere into a tree structure where each
        node in the tree is represented by a spherical triangle.   This can be
        used for fast searching of the sphere and matching lists of points.

    integrate:
        Tools for integration of data and functions.  Currently contains the QGauss
        class for gauss-legendre integration, which relies on the gauleg C++ extension.

    pyfitspatch:
        A patched version of pyfits that allows writing structures (numpy arrays with
        fields, recarrays) to disk in a single call.

    recfile:
        Contains the class Recfile for efficiently reading and writing
        structured numpy arrays to and from binary and ascii files.  Individual
        columns and rows can be selected. 

    stat:
        This packages contains tools for statistical analysis, including an IDL-like
        histogram function.

Sub-modules:
    coords:
        A set of astronomical utilities for dealing with coordinates and
        coordinate transformations.

    cosmology:
        A set of tools for calculating distances in an expanding universe.
        These routines are completely general for any specified omega_m,
        omega_k, and cosmological constant omega_l.  This code follows the
        conventions of Hogg astro-ph/9905116.

    io: 
        File input/output convenience functions.  Read and write many file
        formats using the same read() write() interface.

    json_util:
        Convienience functions for working with JSON files
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

    misc:
        Miscellaneous usefule tools, such as a tool for printing variables
        in column format, pretty printing elapsed time, executing system
        processes, sub-selecting from a dictionary, etc.

    numpy_util:
        A large number of functions for working with numerical python arrays.
        The focus is primarily on structures, aka recarrays or structured
        arrays.  E.g. 
            ahelp: an IDL style help function to show what is
                contained in the structure.
            aprint: printing structures.
            arrscl: scale the range of an array
            combine_arrlist: Combine a list of structures into one big array.
            copy_fields: Copy the fields from on structure to another.
            extract_fields: Extract a subset of fields from a structure, recarray.
            remove_fields: Remove a subset of fields.
            add_fields:  Add new fields to a structure/recarray.
            reorder_fields: Re-order the fields in a structure/recarray.
            split_fields: Split the fields of a structure/recarray into a tuple
                of arrays. No copy is if data is made.
            compare_arrays: Compare structures/recarrays field by field.
            is_big_endian: Check if the array is big endian byte order
            is_little_endian: Check if the array is little endian byte order.
            to_big_endian: convert to big endian
            to_little_endian: convert to little endian
            byteswap: byteswap array with ability to automatically update the
                type descriptor.
            unique: Return unique elements or indices (note now there is a built
                in for this...)
            match: Match the elements two arrays.
            dict2array: Convert a dict to a structure/recarray.
            splitarray: Split rows of the array into chunks of at least a given size.
            randind: Get random indices with replacement in the open range [0,nmax)
