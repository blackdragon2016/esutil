        Method Name:
            match
        
        Purpose:

          Match two sets of ra/dec points using the Hierarchical Triangular
          Mesh code.  This is very efficient for large search angles and large
          lists.  May seem slow otherwise due to overhead creating htm indices.

                                file=None)
        
        Inputs:
            ra1,dec1,ra2,dec2: 
                ra,dec lists in degrees.  Can be scalars or arrays but require
                len(ra) == len(dec) in each set.

          radius: 
              The search radius in degrees.  May be a scalar or an array same
              length as ra1,dec1.
        
        
        Keyword Parameters:

            maxmatch=1: 
                The maximum number of allowed matches per point. Defaults to
                return the closest match, maxmatch=1

            htmid2=None: 
                the htm indexes for the second list.  If not sent they are
                generated internally.  You can generate these with 

                    htmid = h.lookup_id(ra, dec)

            htmrev2=None: 
                The result of
                    import esutil
                    htmid2 = h.lookup_id(ra, dec)
                    minid=htmid2.min()
                    hist2,htmrev2=\\
                        esutil.stat.histogram(htmid2-minid,rev=True) 

                If not sent it is calculated internally for fast lookups.  You
                can save time on successive calls by generating these your
                self.

            minid=None, maxid=None: 
                If htmrev2 is sent along with these, there is no need to
                calculate htmid2.

            file=None: 
                A file into which will be written the indices and distances.
                When this keyword is sent, None,None,None is returned. This is
                useful when the match data will not fit into memory.  
                
                The file is an unformatted binary file. It can be read with the
                read() method. 

                The format is a 64-bit signed integer representing the number
                of rows, followed by rows of 
                  
                  i1 i2 d12

                Where i1,i2 are the match indices as 64-bit signed integers and
                d12 is the distance between them in degrees as a 64-bit float.
        
        Outputs:

            m1,m2,d12: 

                A tuple of m1,m2,d12.  m1 and m2 are the match indices for
                list1 and list2.  d12 is the distance between them in degrees.

                You can subscript the arrays ra1,dec1 with the m1 array, and
                ra2,dec2 with the m2 array.   If you do so the data "line-up"
                so that points in list one and list two at the same index are
                matches.
                

                If no matches are found, or the results were written to a
                file, then a tuple of None,None,None is returned.

        
        Restrictions:
            The C++ wrapper must be compiled.  This will happend automatically
            during installation of esutil.

        Inputs:
            rmin,rmax: Smallest and largest separations to consider.  This
                is in degrees unless the scale= keyword is sent, in which
                case the units are angle*scale with angle in radians.
            nbin:  The number of bins to use.  Bins will be equally spaced

            ra1,dec1,ra2,dec2: 
                ra,dec lists in degrees.  Can be scalars or arrays but require
                len(ra) == len(dec) in each set.
        
        Keyword Parameters:

            scale:  
                A scale to apply to the angular separations.  Must be the same
                length as ra1/dec1 or a scalar.  This is useful for converting
                angle to physical distance.  For example, scale could be the
                angular diameter distance to cosmological objects in list 1.

                If scale is sent, rmin,rmax must be in units of angle*scale
                where angle is in *radians*, as opposed to degrees when scale
                is not sent.

            htmid2=None: 
                the htm indexes for the second list.  If not sent they are
                generated internally.  You can generate these with

                If not sent it is calculated internally for fast lookups.  You
                can save time on successive calls by generating these your
                self.

            getbins: 
                If True, return a tuple 
                    rlower,rupper,counts 

                instead of just counts.  rlower,rupper are the lower and upper
                limits of each bin.  getbins=True is the default.
